<p>[📅]As the name says, the app can be used to plan sessions and check them.The data is stored locally, but the app can be ported quite easily to cloud storage, the app features a logging system, and team-based distribution, with teams presenting separate sessions from each other.</p>
<h4 align = "center"> [📍]A few words about the functionality of the application:[📍] </h4>
<ul>
  <li>[🔐] - Logging in is based on a username and password and is not very complicated, just for local use. </li>
  <li>[📆] - Checking and scheduling sessions is done based on a 'QCalendar' object</li>
  <li>[⏳] - Meetings may have had a title, a description, a date and a time. They cannot be scheduled on the current day or a day in the past.</li>
  <li>[👤] - You can also check your team status, team leader and your role in the team. </li>
</ul>
